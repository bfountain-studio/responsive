      <h3>It is not about the pieces themselves.
It is about the work. About committing 100 % to the work and its concept. It is about our lives, our relation, about the experience, about the act of doing. The pieces are excuses. 
If beauty happens, goodâ€¦ but we are not in search for it. Beauty itself is not satisfying. Any idiot can make pretty work of art, it doesn't make for transcendence. Beauty is only a by-product.
This is research. This is process. And this is autobiographic.</h3>
